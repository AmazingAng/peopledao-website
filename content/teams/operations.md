_“Only through operational excellence can any organization capture and materialize its true and full potential.”_

Since the creation of PeopleDAO, its one goal as a community is to be a hub of support for web3 projects and social good. To this end, the DAO has relied on resourceful contributors to build and maintain the community and help achieve its goal. As the DAO has continued to expand exponentially, the Operations Team has been eventually created to cover all major operational workflows in the DAO.

The Operations team is saddled with the responsibility of providing a single and formalized umbrella for managing various operations in the DAO. The Team is collectively led by PeopleDAO Core contributors.

## Main tasks and responsibilities

- Organizing PeopleDAO Discord server
- Managing task delegation on Dework
- Taking meeting notes and presenting recordings of meetings in audio format (MP3)
- Researching tools to improve the DAO and contributors’ experience
- Creating videos on how to use tools in the DAO (if such videos do not already exist)

## How to join

Joining the Ops team is only through an application. However, tasks from the team would be announced in the bounty board where everyone can freely apply.
