Over time, accounting has been known to be an essential fragment of any organizational structure. From creating timely reports to running in-depth financial assessments, an accounting team has always proven to be very important in the effective management of every organization.

The PeopleDAO's Account Team plays several roles to ensure the communityâ€™s financial well-being by recording all accounting-related information comprehensively, systematically and also making sure they are accessible in real-time.

Since the inception of the team, different goals have been attained in a stretch of previous seasons while some are still in iteration. Among others, adequate financial computation, i.e regulating the DAOâ€™s cash flow, monitoring and improving the rewards payout system, and also preparing monthly spreadsheets for the documentation of rewards payout, regular seasonal reports that contain financial statements and substantial analysis of the DAOâ€™s spending ratio, organizing Demos and making tutorials for several DeFi platforms, or handling of wallet/payout-related complaints.

## Main tasks and responsibilities

- Maintaining monthly spreadsheets for proper documentation of reward payout and also cross-checking for accurate wallet information in the spreadsheet
- Creating monthly reviews and tracking of each teamâ€™s task board to ensure a correct and corresponding payout
- Preparing reports and research that contain seasonal accounting information such as total cash flow(inflow-outflow), and financial insights
- Creating monthly infographics where the DAOâ€™s monthly expenditures are displayed and broken down according to each teamâ€™s spending
