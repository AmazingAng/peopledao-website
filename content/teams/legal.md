The Legal Team is responsible for working on projects with governance-related procedural concerns. These can involve conducting elections, assisting with constitutional revisions, completing and publishing Snapshots.

Additionally, the Legal Team is in charge of planning the impeachment, dispute, and code of conduct review procedures. In general, the Team is not allowed to serve as a court, with the exception of serving as an arbitrator or mediator in a small dispute. In the event of a significant conflict, the Team should choose an unbiased third party or establish an impartial committee.

Contracts between PeopleDAO and DAOs we are working with as well as between subDAO and metaDAO are also drafted by the legal team.
