  <p>People DAO was born from a landmark event in Web3 symbolizing the power of human coordination. In mid-November 2021 a group of internet friends decided to buy a copy of the US Constitution. The resulting social movement, Constitution DAO, raised $45M but was outbid by the CEO of Citadel, Ken Griffin.</p>
  <p>People DAO formed in the wake of the failed attempt, adopting $PEOPLE for our governance, compelled by the unique properties of the token and story. People DAO officially established itself on December 6th following a Snapshot vote. Shared values emerged, including intercultural exchange and altruism (#PeopleHelpPeople). We embrace the meme aspect of the $PEOPLE token because it keeps life fun.</p>
  <p>Self-identifying as a metaDAO, we are committed to acting as a designer, funder, and supporter of DAOs and projects which advance Web3 and improve social good. We welcome all people to join our almost-7,000 Discord members in developing the People DAO infrastructure and working together to apply our energy.</p>
