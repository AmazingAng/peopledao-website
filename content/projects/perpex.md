Perpetual Decentralized Exchange, PERPEX, is a DeFi platform that is governed by the Perpetual DAO subDAO. Perpetual features act like a contract to buy an asset at a future date, and the blockchain can enable high leverage speculation with this financial instrument. It is a new and intuitive platform where users can buy, sell, hold and speculate in crypto assets, especially perpetual futures.
