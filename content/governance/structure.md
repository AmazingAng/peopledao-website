## Roles

Active contributing members in PeopleDAO hold one of the defined roles:

- **Administrators:** Founders and core contributors of the DAO. They are responsible for leading the DAO's strategic decisions and defining its general direction.
- **Multisignee:** Members managing and reviewing DAO's treasury operations. More details about the treasury and signee role are available below on this page.
- **Team (co-)leads:** Each team has a single or multiple leads organizing its activities and operations. They are responsible for the team's budget and actively cooperate with team contributors to fulfill seasonal goals.
- **Moderators:** Members taking care of community on the Discord server and enforcing the server's rules. They are knowledgeable about the DAO and actively assist community members with their questions or issues.
- **Active contributors:** All DAO members that are contributing to DAO's seasonal goals through respective teams that they join. They are the primary building block of PeopleDAO.

All members are able to periodically meet through one of the community-wide events, such as _(1)_ Fireside Chat, held on Twitter Spaces or Discord voice chat, designed to update the community members with latest updates and address any pending questions, or _(2)_ Contributor Call, where team-related progress on seasonal goals is discussed.

## Teams

PeopleDAO consists of multiple teams taking care of their respective areas of contribution within the DAO. You can find detailed profiles of individual teams on a [dedicated page](/teams).

Each team is led by **team (co-)leads**, defining team's seasonal goals, managing tasks and organizing the work in the team. **Active contributors** of the DAO are welcome to apply to and join any team within their skillset, and contribute to tasks in order to fulfill the current objectives. Where applicable, teams collaborate with each other in order to deliver the best combined results for the given task.

The organization is specific for each team, including the onboarding process, seasonal goals definition, task assignments and team meetings.

## Multisig

The multisig is an elected group of DAO's members responsible for managing DAO's treasury operations. All PeopleDAO's financial operations are handled through <a href={LINK_TOOL_GNOSISSAFE} target="_blank">Safe</a> multisig wallet, where signees have to review pending transactions to ensure its validity.

The term for the role is static and at the end of each period a new election is conducted on <a href={LINK_TOOL_SNAPSHOT} target="_blank">Snapshot</a> after self-nomination and introduction in the Discord server. Any active contributors are welcome to apply for this role, however there is a great emphasis on the impact of previous contributions and continuous activity for the successful fulfillment of this role.
